MKVPropEdit GUI
===============

MKVPropEdit GUI is a wrapper for mkvpropedit console application by Moritz Bunkus.
It provides quick, easy and friendly way to edit MKV metadata such as: overall title, track name, track language, track flags, ordering of tracks.

Package contents
----------------

Software is distributed in binary mode together with two necessary console utilities. All binaries are UPX-compressed (if your anvivirus software dislikes these binaries, just un-UPX them). Source code is not distributed because despite it's quite trivial it uses some libs which are not ready to be released to public yet.

Usage
-----

Run the software, paste path to a MKV file and press [Load] or drop it from Explorer onto the application window. Do some changes then press [Save].
